## 3-Week Launch Plan

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **1** | Fix Blockers | ZIP download, error handling, loading states, deploy |
| **2** | Quality | Tests (50%), E2E, accessibility, performance |
| **3** | Launch Prep | Landing page, demo video, PH/Twitter/Reddit |

**Success Criteria**: 100 signups in Week 1, >90% generation success rate, 5+ paying users

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Wedge Market: Indie Hackers & Solopreneurs
**Why**: High pain, low sophistication, price sensitive, vocal, fast decisions
**Value Prop**: "Ship your landing page in 30 seconds, not 3 weeks"
**Channels**: Product Hunt, Hacker News, Twitter, Indie Hackers

### Expansion: Agencies & Freelancers → Enterprises

### Growth Loops Built In:
1. **Viral Attribution**: "Built with WebWiz" footer link
2. **Gallery Effect**: Public showcase with "Clone this site" CTA
3. **API Network**: Developer integrations create user growth

---

## Monetization

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 3 generations/month, manual deploy |
| **Pro** | $20/mo | Unlimited, auto-deploy, analytics |
| **Agency** | $99/mo | White-label, API, 100 sites/month |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | SSO, SLA, custom training |

**Target**: $1K MRR by Month 3, $10K by Month 6, $50K by Month 12

---

## Key Metrics

### North Star: **Sites Generating Value** (deployed + receiving traffic)

**Leading Indicators** (weekly):
- Generation success rate (target: >95%)
- Time-to-live (target: <60s future, <15min current)
- User activation (target: >70%)
- Week-1 retention (target: >30%)

**Lagging Indicators** (monthly):
- MRR (Month 3: $1K, Month 6: $10K)
- Free→Paid conversion (target: >5%)
- NPS (target: >50)
- LTV:CAC ratio (target: >3:1)

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| AI costs spiral | HIGH | Aggressive caching (70% hit rate), rate limits, fine-tuning |
| Claude API downtime | MEDIUM | Multi-provider fallback (GPT-4), queue system, status page |
| Low quality output | MEDIUM | Quality scoring, human review (paid), iterative prompting |
| Free→Paid conversion | MEDIUM | Feature gating, usage limits, social proof |
| Competitors copy | HIGH | Ship faster, network effects, data moat, brand |

---

## SpaceX-Level Forcing Functions

1. **Public Building**: Weekly metrics on Twitter (accountability)
2. **Speed as Core Value**: Every feature has latency budget
3. **Dogfooding**: WebWiz site built with WebWiz
4. **First Principles**: Question everything monthly
5. **Metrics-Driven**: Data over opinions, kill low-engagement features

---

## Why Now?

**Convergence of 3 trends**:
1. AI Democratization (creation accessible to everyone)
2. No-Code Movement (build without coding)
3. Speed Economy (slow = death, fast = advantage)

**Window**: Next 12 months define the category. First-mover advantage critical.

---

## The Moat

**3 Layers**:
1. **Speed** (6-12 months): First to market, first to instant deploy
2. **Data** (1-3 years): Proprietary benchmarks, conversion AI training
3. **Platform** (3+ years): Plugin ecosystem, agency partnerships, enterprise

**Ultimate**: Brand = Category ("AI landing pages" = "WebWiz" like "search" = "Google")

---

## Decision: Ship or Pivot?

### SHIP. Here's why:

1. MVP is solid (core works)
2. Market is ready (AI adoption inflection)
3. Risk is low (side project budget)
4. Upside is massive (10K+ potential users)
5. Learning is valuable (AI products experience)

---

## Immediate Next Steps

**This Week**:
1. Implement ZIP download (Day 1-2)
2. Add error handling (Day 3)
3. Loading states (Day 4)
4. Deploy to Vercel (Day 5)

**Week 2**: Tests + quality
**Week 3**: Launch prep
**Week 4**: Product Hunt launch → Iterate based on feedback

---

## Success Definition

**3 Weeks**: Launched on Product Hunt with 100+ signups
**3 Months**: Product-market fit signals (30% retention, $1K MRR)
**12 Months**: Category leader ($50K MRR, 5K live sites, known brand)

---

## The Inevitable Question: What Makes This Work?

**Answer**: AI is finally good enough + cheap enough + accessible enough to replace manual landing page creation.

**Timing**: 2018 too early (AI not ready). 2022 too early (AI too expensive). 2025 perfect (quality + cost + awareness aligned).

**Execution**: Ship fast, learn fast, iterate fast. SpaceX-level speed with indie hacker agility.

---

## Key Insights from MARS Analysis

1. **Don't build a tool, build a platform** with network effects
2. **Speed is a feature** - 30 seconds vs 15 minutes is 10x, not 30x
3. **Data is the moat** - aggregate intelligence creates defensibility
4. **Dogfood everything** - WebWiz site built with WebWiz = credibility
5. **API unlocks B2B** - developers and agencies are multipliers
6. **Public building** creates accountability and community
7. **First-mover window** is 12 months before market saturates
8. **Focus matters** - landing pages only, do them excellently
9. **User feedback > opinions** - ship, measure, learn, iterate
10. **Kill criteria** are as important as success criteria

---

## Architectural Evolution

**Current**: User → AI → Template → Files → Manual Deploy

**Target**: User → AI → [Unique Layout] → Instant Live URL → [Feedback Loop] → Continuous Evolution

**Bridge**: Incremental transformation (instant deploy first, then evolution, then layout AI)

---

## Positioning Statement

"Wix is too complex. Templates are too limiting. Designers are too expensive. **WebWiz is your AI co-founder that ships your landing page while you sleep.**"

---

## Competitive Advantage

| Competitor | WebWiz Advantage |
|------------|------------------|
| Wix/Webflow | Speed: 30 sec vs 3 hours |
| v0.dev | Accessibility: No code editing |
| Templates | Intelligence: AI-optimized |
| Carrd | Evolution: Continuous improvement |
| Framer | Simplicity: Natural language |

---

## Team & Resources

**Now**: Solo (you)
**Month 4**: +1 Full-stack developer
**Month 12**: 5 people (backend, frontend, AI, growth, operations)

**Culture**: Speed, transparency, autonomy, learning, remote-first

---

## Financial Projections

**Conservative**:
- Month 3: $1K MRR (50 paying users @ $20)
- Month 6: $10K MRR (200 paying @ $20 + 50 agency @ $99)
- Month 12: $50K MRR (500 paying + 100 agency + 10 enterprise)

**Optimistic** (if breakthrough features hit):
- Month 12: $100K MRR
- Year 2: $500K MRR
- Year 3: $2M MRR (acquisition target)

---

## Exit Strategy

**Acquirers** (if you want to exit):
- **Vercel**: AI-powered site generation fits their platform
- **Netlify**: Competing with Vercel, need AI capabilities
- **Wix/Webflow**: Add AI to existing builder
- **Shopify**: Landing pages for merchants
- **Salesforce**: Marketing Cloud integration

**Timing**: 18-24 months (once revenue proves model)
**Valuation**: 5-10x ARR (typical for SaaS with growth)

---

## The Ultimate Measure

**Not**: How many features shipped
**Not**: How much code written
**Not**: How much revenue generated

**But**: **How many people shipped their ideas faster because WebWiz existed?**

If the answer is "thousands," you've succeeded.

---

## One-Sentence Vision

**WebWiz makes creating landing pages so fast that shipping becomes the default, not the exception.**

---

## Your Move

You have:
- ✅ Solid MVP foundation
- ✅ Clear strategic vision
- ✅ 3-week tactical plan
